# SharpConverter

## DESCRIPTION
A C# console conversion tool for converting between number systems, IEEE 754 single-precision, and to and from Unicode standard in .NET6.
Mostly just built for a small practice project. Building it extensibly, so base code can easily be applied to a different framework (Blazor, Xamarin, WPF, etc...).
There are a bazillion tools like this online, this is mostly as a way for me to practice developing algorithms

## BUILDING
You can download the latest release under the releases for this project, the 'Latest' tag will have the most current release. You do not need .NET runtime to run the .exe file.

## LICENSE
I am not reinventing the wheel by any means, but if you do like any of my approaches to solving these problems feel free to use them! I'm sure many have solved conversion problems in .NET before me so need to attribute or credit.

## CONTRIBUTE
If you know of any better solutions, request away and show me! Always eager to learn different approaches, and any suggestion on an aspect that can be improved on is more than welcome ☺️

## NOTES
Will add a table here with updates as more of the code base is developped. Look at commit messages for current updates.
